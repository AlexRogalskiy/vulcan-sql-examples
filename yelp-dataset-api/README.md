# Yelp Dataset API

## Project Introduction

In this project, we try to integrate VulcanSQL with LangChain and Cohere.
We demonstrate how effortlessly VulcanSQL can create and share secure data APIs. VulcanSQL has built-in [data privacy mechanisms](https://vulcansql.com/docs/data-privacy/overview) to protect sensitive data.

In this project for example, data from the column `tip_user_id` is being masked.
